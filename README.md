# ![[Using Classes] - Starter Code](./internal-resources/assets/tktk-hero.png)

## Builder instructions

Some general notes as you construct this module:

- ***This entire repo is intended to be student-facing. Keep this in mind as you add content to it.***
- When adding starter code, treat the directory that holds this README file as the root of the project. Do not bundle starter code inside of a child directory.
- This README should not provide any information beyond a simple intro to simplify maintenance. The main lab repo should hold all setup steps and background information about the starter code. Do not duplicate that work here.
- Students are instructed that they can delete this README and the `internal-resources` directory when they use this starter code, making the above point even more important.
- Do not add links to any other module from this module.
- tktk Delete the entire **Builder instructions** section and all its subsections after you've wrapped up work here. ***None of this content should remain***.

### Module List

Add a new row for this starter code module in the [Module List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGkjkd8n35UjuzAHifrBAZ8eXw14WdOjEYbiMUojsYU/edit#gid=0).

- This starter code module should be placed directly beneath the main module for this lab on the spreadsheet.
- In the *Module name* column (*A*), write the name of the lab and add ` - Starter Code`. For example if base lab's name is `Intro to Arrays Lab`, the name for this module will be `Intro to Arrays Lab - Starter Code`. Add a link to this repo.
- In the *Module type* column (*B*), select **Lab Starter**.
- In the *Preferred delivery method?*, *Core or Level Up content?*, *Did delivery cadence change?*, and *Module status* columns (*C*, *D*, *E*, and *F*), select the same option as the base lab module.
- In the *Name/Link to legacy content* column (*G*), link to the legacy content's starter code if available.

### Asana

Add a card for this module on the Executing list in the [SEI 3.0 Instructor Project Board Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1205797712826953/1205825207464955).

- Add yourself as the *Assignee*.
- Add the same *Due date* that's listed on the card for the base lab module.
- Set the *Type* to **Module: Lesson**.
- Set the *Delivery Method* to **Async**.
- Assign the same people to *Planning + Content Scoping*, *Executing*, *QA Pass 1*, *QA Pass 2*, *Assets Creation*, and *QA 3 - Learning Team* as listed on the card for the base lab module
- Add an attachment to the card linking to the legacy content if any exists. Write `Legacy content` in the **Display text** field.
- Add an attachment to the card linking to the module repo. Write `Module repo` in the **Display text** field.

### Local environment

Prepare to work with this content.

- Fork the module you have just created to your GHE account, then clone it to your machine.
- Set the upstream.
- Switch to a feature branch.
- Refer to the [GHE Workflow document](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/README/blob/main/ghe-workflow.md) for details.

### Build the module

Follow these steps:

- Note any qualities that make this lab content unique or in need of further discussion. Escalate any concerns to `#modularization-sei` on Slack.
- Do a find and replace search for `[tktk Module Name]`. Replace this with the name of the module in title case (all important words capitalized).
- Create new content or bring legacy content into this module.
- Follow the same [execution steps](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/README/blob/main/creating-modules/phase-2-execution.md#execution-repeat-for-each-microlesson) that you would for a regular microlesson.
- When that work is complete, move the card for this work to the **QA Pass 1** list on the [SEI 3.0 Instructor Project Board Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1205797712826953/1205825207464955) board.
- You're done! This work is now ready to be passed off to a first reviewer.

### QA the module

Hello, first reviewer! Follow the same [QA pass one](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/README/blob/main/creating-modules/phase-3-qa-and-wrap-up.md#qa-pass-one-microlesson---repeat-for-each) steps you would for a regular microlesson.

When that work is complete, move the card for this work to the **QA Pass 2** list on the [SEI 3.0 Instructor Project Board Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1205797712826953/1205825207464955)) board.

You're done! This work is now ready to be passed off to a second reviewer.

### QA the module (second pass)

Hello, second reviewer! Follow the same [QA pass two](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/README/blob/main/creating-modules/phase-3-qa-and-wrap-up.md#qa-pass-two-microlesson---repeat-for-each) steps you would for a regular microlesson.

After completing your review, move this card to the **Wrap Up** list on the [SEI 3.0 Instructor Project Board Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1205797712826953/1205825207464955) board.

### Wrap-up

Follow the same [Wrap-up](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/README/blob/main/creating-modules/phase-3-qa-and-wrap-up.md#wrap-up) steps you would for a regular module.

When you're done, move this card to the **Completed Work** list on the [SEI 3.0 Instructor Project Board Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1205797712826953/1205825207464955) board.

tktk When that work is done, delete the **Builder instructions** section and its subsections.
